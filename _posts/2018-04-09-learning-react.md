Having been working on email for the past 3-4 years I have regrettably not been keeping up with my frontend development stacks. Things have changed dramatically since 2014, particularly the traction that React & React-native have gotten at startups these days. Nearly every job description that I see mentions React.

Teaching an old dog new tricks

First things first, I had to figure out how to get any of this to install.

I need multiple versions of `node.js` on my computer so I installed `nvm`. I had a hell of a time getting even the "Getting Started" steps for React-native to run properly. My version of Node was too old, then my version of NPM was too new. As of this writing 4/2018, I have settled on this environment:

* React-native 0.52
* React 16.2
* Node 8.1.0
* NPM 4.6.1
