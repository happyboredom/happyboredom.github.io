We've been trying to get an accessory dwelling unit built in the backyard. Here is the timeline thus far:

* Weeks 0-3: Interview & choose architect
* Week 4-5: Agree on terms with architect. Design process begins!
* Week 6: Before we can design we need to take a survey of the property. Send proposals to surveyor(s). 
* Week 7-8: It takes 2 weeks to get proposals from surveyors.
* Week 9: Surveyor's was supposed to show up but his car broke down. Re-schedule.
* Week 10-14: Surveyor measures property but is backlogged on work. Returns survey results about 4 weeks after site visit.
* Week 15-19: Architect draws up plans for remodel + ADU. Feedback on plans
* Week 20: Agree on ADU plan
* Week 21: Search for structural engineer to design the building
* Week 22-24: Structural engineer does his magic
* Week 25: Submit plan to city!
* Week 25-?: City permit review.
