I've been messing with AMP for email and there seem to be a lot of barriers to entry that would prevent widespread adoption of this product. There are a lot of moving parts that need to be touched in order for this to work.

HTML Email requirements
----
Somebody needs to learn the AMP-specific flavor of Moustache templating. It appears that the AMP for email environment supports (or does not support) the same set of CSS and HTML as normal desktop Gmail so you can use that knowledge which is a specific set of quirks.

Backend requirements
----
In order to make the most of AMP product you need to produce specific AMP-friendly JSON response which must be a very specific format that may be different from your organization's payload.

Security/web-server requirements
----
For security and authentication purposes the AMP specification requires you to accept and pass back specific HTTP headers related to a CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) configuration for your endpoint. As such, you might need to talk to a platform or security person in your organization for these modifications.

Email format requirements
----
You have to be able to specify an additional MIME type for your content which, for me, has involved making changes to the email-sending code. Again, you may have an email infrastructure team that you may need to coordinate with in order to get this work done.

Indeed working on AMP for email is quintessential "full stack" development.
