Integrated A/B tester

Components:
* Java Storm job to count events and store in Redis.
* Node.js API to provide a visual UI to monitor realtime results.


Event-counting Storm Job
----

Storm bolt written in Java to observe incoming events. This looks specifically for email events and stores counters in Redis. Armed with this raw data I can write a web app to interpret the data.

Sample data collected: (`hincrby <campaign> <action> <value>`)
* `campaign1`
  * send: 1,000,000
  * opens: 10,000
  * clicks: 5,000
* `campaign2`
  * send: 500,000
  * opens: 10,000
  * clicks: 5,000

* Tracking set of `campaigns`. A raw count of ALL events for that campaign. 
  * `zincrby <campaign> <value>`
  * `zrangebyscore "stats:email" 0 +inf`
    * campaign1: 1,015,000 
    * campaign2:   515,000

Data interpreting web app
----

Node/Express API to read the data above and interpret into actionable data.

`/api/stats`
* lists all tracked campaigns.

Output
```
["campaign1", "campaign2"]
```

`/api/stats/:campaign:`
* get stats for the campaign

Output
```
{
  campaignKey: "campaign1",
  data: {
    click: "18",
    open: "18",
    send: "24"
  }
}
```

`/api/stats/:campaign1:/:campaign2:`
* compare 2 campaigns
```
[
  {
    "campaignKey": "campaign1",
    "data": {
      "click": "18",
      "open": "18",
      "send": "24"
    },
    "calculated": {
      "openrate": 0.75
    }
  },
  {
    "campaignKey": "campaign2",
    "data": {
      "click": "11",
      "open": "11",
      "send": "11"
    },
    "calculated": {
      "openrate": 1
    }
  }
]
```

Interesting libraries
----

[jStat](https://github.com/jstat/jstat) - for doing the statistical significance calculations in the Node API.
